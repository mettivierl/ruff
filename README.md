  <i>Linting the CPython codebase from scratch.</i>
</p>

- ⚡️ 10-100x faster than existing linters (like Flake8) and formatters (like Black)
- 🐍 Installable via `pip`
- 🛠️ `pyproject.toml` support
- 🤝 Python 3.13 compatibility
- ⚖️ Drop-in parity with [Flake8](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/faq/#how-does-ruffs-linter-compare-to-flake8), isort, and [Black](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/faq/#how-does-ruffs-formatter-compare-to-black)
- 📦 Built-in caching, to avoid re-analyzing unchanged files
- 🔧 Fix support, for automatic error correction (e.g., automatically remove unused imports)
- 📏 Over [800 built-in rules](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/), with native re-implementations
    of popular Flake8 plugins, like flake8-bugbear
- ⌨️ First-party [editor integrations](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/integrations/) for
    [VS Code](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-vscode) and [more](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/editors/setup)
- 🌎 Monorepo-friendly, with [hierarchical and cascading configuration](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/configuration/#config-file-discovery)

Ruff aims to be orders of magnitude faster than alternative tools while integrating more
functionality behind a single, common interface.

Ruff can be used to replace [Flake8](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/) (plus dozens of plugins),
[Black](https://github.com/psf/black), [isort](https://pypi.org/project/isort/),
[pydocstyle](https://pypi.org/project/pydocstyle/), [pyupgrade](https://pypi.org/project/pyupgrade/),
[autoflake](https://pypi.org/project/autoflake/), and more, all while executing tens or hundreds of
times faster than any individual tool.

Ruff is extremely actively developed and used in major open-source projects like:

- [Apache Airflow](https://github.com/apache/airflow)
- [Apache Superset](https://github.com/apache/superset)
- [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi)
- [Hugging Face](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)
- [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas)
- [SciPy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy)

...and [many more](#whos-using-ruff).

Ruff is backed by [Astral](https://astral.sh). Read the [launch post](https://astral.sh/blog/announcing-astral-the-company-behind-ruff),
or the original [project announcement](https://notes.crmarsh.com/python-tooling-could-be-much-much-faster).

## Testimonials

[**Sebastián Ramírez**](https://twitter.com/tiangolo/status/1591912354882764802), creator
of [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi):

> Ruff is so fast that sometimes I add an intentional bug in the code just to confirm it's actually
> running and checking the code.

[**Nick Schrock**](https://twitter.com/schrockn/status/1612615862904827904), founder of [Elementl](https://www.elementl.com/),
co-creator of [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/):

> Why is Ruff a gamechanger? Primarily because it is nearly 1000x faster. Literally. Not a typo. On
> our largest module (dagster itself, 250k LOC) pylint takes about 2.5 minutes, parallelized across 4
> cores on my M1. Running ruff against our _entire_ codebase takes .4 seconds.

[**Bryan Van de Ven**](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/pull/12605), co-creator
of [Bokeh](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/), original author
of [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/):

> Ruff is ~150-200x faster than flake8 on my machine, scanning the whole repo takes ~0.2s instead of
> ~20s. This is an enormous quality of life improvement for local dev. It's fast enough that I added
> it as an actual commit hook, which is terrific.

[**Timothy Crosley**](https://twitter.com/timothycrosley/status/1606420868514877440),
creator of [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort):

> Just switched my first project to Ruff. Only one downside so far: it's so fast I couldn't believe
> it was working till I intentionally introduced some errors.

[**Tim Abbott**](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/465#issuecomment-1317400028), lead
developer of [Zulip](https://github.com/zulip/zulip):

> This is just ridiculously fast... `ruff` is amazing.
